    "For our proposal, we decided to focus on three major American cities: Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York. We decided to change the scope to focus on Chicago data only, because the data that was in the other cities was not consistent, and they were not as in-depth as the Chicago dataset was. The Chicago data portal offers three very detailed data sets that will provide a better analysis than our previously proposed scope. Changing our scope to focusing on Chicago data will allow us to focus our efforts on analyzing the data instead of spending lots of time cleaning the three separate cities’ data sets and trying to pull common relevant information from each."

This will provide us with the means to create heat maps of various traffic accidents by locations and an analysis of damages. Utilizing the Chicago data portal will also allow a wider analysis of the following Traffic Crash data sets via a crash_record_id column that is present in all three data sets. "

Each mode of transportation involved in a crash is a “unit” and get one entry here. Each vehicle, each pedestrian, each motorcyclist, and each bicyclist is considered an independent unit that can have a trajectory separate from the other units.” ( description provided by:  https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Traffic-Crashes-Vehicles/68nd-jvt3/about_data )\n",

This data set will be instrumental in our analysis of the human factor of these crashes, as well as quantifying impact and safety of driving practices. We will also be able to use the crash_record_id to perform any analysis of crash records based on age or sex, which will also be important for our hypotheses and exploratory analysis."
